#
# ============================================================================
# TIPS
# ============================================================================
#
# Location Names:
#   - Be specific: "Paris, France" is better than just "Paris"
#   - Include country for clarity
#   - Use standard place names for best geocoding results
#
# Multiple Locations:
#   - List all locations where the book is set
#   - Each location will get its own marker on the map
#
# Coordinates:
#   - If you know lat/lng, include them to skip geocoding
#   - Latitude: -90 to 90
#   - Longitude: -180 to 180
#
# Covers:
#   - Use publicly accessible image URLs
#   - Recommended size: 200-300px wide
#   - Must start with http:// or https://
#
# Review Links:
#   - Full URLs to your review pages
#   - Links open in a new tab when clicked
#   - Must start with http:// or https://
#
# ============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================================================
#
# Location not found?
#   - Be more specific: "Paris, France" instead of "Paris"
#   - Check spelling
#   - Add coordinates manually if you know them
#
# Multiple books in same city?
#   - No problem! The map automatically clusters them together
#   - Click a cluster to expand and see all books
#   - Zoom in to separate clustered markers
#
# Build taking too long?
#   - First build geocodes all locations (1 per second rate limit)
#   - Subsequent builds use cached coordinates and are much faster
#
# Validation errors?
#   - Check that required fields (title, locations) are present
#   - Ensure locations is a list with at least one entry
#   - Verify location names are non-empty strings
#   - Check that coordinates (if provided) are valid numbers in correct ranges
#
