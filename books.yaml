# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================================================
#
# Location not found?
#   - Be more specific: "Paris, France" instead of "Paris"
#   - Check spelling
#   - Add coordinates manually if you know them
#
# Multiple books in same city?
#   - No problem! The map automatically clusters them together
#   - Click a cluster to expand and see all books
#
# Build taking too long?
#   - First build geocodes all locations (1 per second rate limit)
#   - Subsequent builds use cached coordinates and are much faster
