# Project Rules for Book Location Map

## Git and Testing Workflow
- ALWAYS test and verify functionality works BEFORE committing
- When making changes to code that generates output (like build.py), run the build and verify the output before any git commit
- For this project: run `python3 build.py` and check that output/index.html and output/preview.html work correctly
- Never commit untested code
- If tests fail or output is broken, fix it before committing

## Code Quality
- Fix any linter errors before considering work complete
- Read generated files to verify they contain expected content
- Don't assume code works - verify it

## Documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with actual implementation
- Don't use "wife" or mention "Erin" by name in documentation
- Keep project simple - avoid feature creep

## General
- Test first, commit second
- When in doubt, verify before acting
